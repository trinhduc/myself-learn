Check that you have the correct repository enabled

First, check that the universe repository is enabled by inspecting '/etc/apt/sources.list' with your favourite editor.

You will need to use sudo to ensure that you have permissions to edit the file.

sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list

If universe is not included then modify the file so that it does.

deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial main universe

After any changes you should run this command to update your system.

sudo apt-get update

You can now install the package like this.
Installkicad

sudo apt-get install kicad

Which will installkicadand any other packages on which it depends.
