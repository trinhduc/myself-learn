- If you want to use the I/O library you must include <stdio.h>

- The type of the function is void, its name is show_message. 
	The parentheses() following the function name are needed to 
	let the compiler know that at this point we are talking about a function 
	and not something else.
- The most important thing about main is that it is the first function to be
called

or example, 5/2 gives 2, 5/3 gives 1. 
			5%2 gives 1, 5%3 gives 2

- an understanding of form, style, elegance and the poetry of a well written program
